## Installation

todo

## Configuration

Configuration is done via a toml file located at `$HOME/.config/rufet/config.toml`
Everything is separated into modules, such as `[data]`, `[logo]`,`[data.hostname]`, and each of these modules has variables that dictate how the module will be displayed. Some of the modules have unique variables. [Those variables will be mentioned below](#unique-variables).

    [data]
    format="$hostname$os"
    height=10
    margin=2
    padding=5

    [data.hostname]
    format="this is my  hostname: $value"

    [logo]
    format="logo"

    [[logo.rule]]
    id="logo"
    exec='echo -ne "$(<$HOME/.config/rufet/ansi)" \\n'

### Variables

#### format

Changes the text that the module will display. Each module will replace `$value` with the value of what the module fetches. So hostname will replace `$value` with the hostname of the user.

    [data.hostname]
    	format="This is my hostname: $value"

#### height

Changes the minimum number of lines the module takes up. Useful if you want to have some space between the module and it's border, or if you want to make the data modules be the same height as the logo.
[data]
height=25

#### padding

Adds blanks characters to the left and right of the module but within the border, useful if you want some space between the module and the border to the sides.
[data.kernel]
padding=25

#### margin

Adds blanks characters to the left and right of the module but outside the border, useful if you want some space between 2 modules separated by borders
[data]
margin=2

#### alignment

Changes the way the text inside a module is aligned
[data]
alignment= "left"|"center"|"right"

### Unique variables

#### Data

the data module, which holds all the modules has inbuilt ids for each of the module `$hostname`,`$os` etc.
but it also has `$all` which will display all of the available modules that have not yet been used. So if you want to always display your memory usage first, you'd do `format="$memory$all"`

#### Uptime

Uptime has a variable `time_format` which formats the time it displays.
Example: `time_format="Uptime is: $d days, $h hours, $m minutes, $s seconds"`

### Customizing the border

The border is a structure inside each module. It has it's own variables which can be customized like so:

    [data.hostname.border]
    top: ['╭', '─', '╮'],
    bottom: ['╰', '─', '╯'],
    sides: ['│', '│'],
    visible: true,
    color: "#ff00ff",
    background: "255;0;0",

### Rules

If you want to have a custom module that displays text, or executes a script, you do so via `rules`, a rule is a a structure which has an `id` , which, when found in other modules will be replaced with a value.
Rules can be used to make custom modules or to change the color and appearance of existing modules.
Variables for a rule:

    id: "id to replace"
    text: "text"
    exec: "shell command"
    color: "#fff"|"0;0;0"
    background: "#fff"|"0;0;0"
    effects: ["bold","faint","italic","underline","blink","reverse","conceal","crossed"]
    border: Border
    padding: int
    margin: int
    alignment: String


If the `text` variable isn't set, it will replace `id` with itself, while giving it the color. Useful if you want to change the color of a predefined id, like `$value`
the `text` variable has priority over `exec`,

#### Changing colors

Change the value of the `color` and `background` variables, they support hex code colors such as `#f0f` and `#ff00ff` , and rgb seperated by a `;` , such as `255;0;255`

    [data.hostname]
    	format="this is my red hostname: $value , $blue"
    	[[data.hostname.rule]]
    	    id="$value"
    	    color="#ff0000"
    	[[data.hostname.rule]]
    	    id="$blue"
    	    text="this is blue text with a green background"
    	    color="#0000ff"
    	    background="#00ff00"

#### Custom modules

Custom modules are still rules, but instead of using the `text` variable to choose the `id`, you use the `exec` variable to execute a shell command that prints to the standard output.

    [data]
      format="$custom1"
      [[data.rule]]
        id="$custom1"
        exec="echo -n aaa"
        padding=5
        [data.rule.border]
          color="#f00"
          visible=true

#### ANSI logo

Due to the way toml is made, it doesn't support the `\e` escape code used for ANSI art, or any other escape code used for it, the only way to get ANSI art inside a toml is with the `\u001B` escape code, for that you'd have to use an image to ANSI converter and then replace all of the escape codes with `\u001B` , instead of that, it's recommended to use a rule which then uses a command to print the contents of the file, such as `echo`, or any script of your choice. That will make it easier and also make the config file less clustered.

    [logo]
    	format="logo"
    	[[logo.rule]]
    	  id="logo"
    	  exec='echo -ne "$(<$HOME/.config/rufet/ansi)" \\n'
